# Checkout Kata

This is the completed kata to add, remove and apply specified offers to items within a basket.

## To build the app

Navigate to the CheckoutMain file and run:

> dotnet build

## To run the tests

Navigate to the CheckoutTest file and run:

> dotnet test

### Notes on the Kata

This kata is purely logical, therefore there is no interactive UI experience.

Unit tests show my working and that the requirements of the task have been met.

Items and offers have been created on the fly in unit tests. In a full application these would represent data transfer objects from an external database.

This could be extended further as an interactive console app or MVC but is at present a MVP.
